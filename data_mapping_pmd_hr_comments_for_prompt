So lets talk about the data.

The data can be normalized into essentialy 4 tables:
1. organizations
2. positions
3. employees
4. pds (position descriptions)

An organization has a single supervisor for that organization. Every organizaton has 1 or more positions under it, and multiple leves deep .

The data provided represents the employees in a single organization.

Key Fields
`organizations` pk = `dept_id`
`positions` pk = `position_number` or sometimes called `HRSPOS` or `HRS_POS`
`positions` secondary primary key `UPI` - a legacy ID that is still heavily in use across the organization. One `position_number` corresponds to one and only one `UPI` and the same is true in reverse. 
`employees` pk = `employee_id` or sometimes called `HRSID` or `HRSEmpId` or `HRSEmp_ID` or `HRS_Emp_Id`
`pds` pk = `posno` or `pd ftl`
